<h1 align="center">No Pupil Left Behind</h1>
<p align="center">
  A web platform that helps blind and visually impaired students organise and revisit lectures.<br/>
  <em>Built at AdaHack: Code for Change • Ljubljana • 22–23 October 2025</em>
</p>

The idea was:

> An existing device by <strong>Plaud</strong> already records and saves audio for blind people.  
> How can we build a digital layer on top of those recordings to make learning easier?

**No Pupil Left Behind** connects to that idea: instead of just having raw audio, students get
structured, searchable, and accessible lecture notes.

##  Key Features

- 🧠 **Automatic organization & metadata**  
  AI-generated metadata such as lecture title, topic, description, and tags.

- 🔍 **Full-text search across transcripts & notes**  
  Quickly find a concept, example, or definition in all lectures.

- 🗂️ **Simple keyboard navigation**  
  Move between subjects, lectures, and topics using only the keyboard.

- 🗣️ **Narrator that announces context**  
  Screen-reader–friendly structure that tells you *where you are* in the app.
